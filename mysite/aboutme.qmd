# **About Me**


Hi, I’m **Cassie L. Lu**. I'm currently pursuing my **Master’s in Applied Business Analytics** at **Boston University (2024–2026)**. Here, I'm learning advanced skills in data analysis, visualization, and business decision-making.


Before joining BU, I earned a **Bachelor’s degree in French Language and Literature** from **Xianda College, Shanghai International Studies University (2020–2024)**. My studies gave me strong analytical abilities, language skills, and cross-cultural understanding.


During college, I worked remotely as a **Data Analyst** for **Rishun Industry & Trade Co. (2021–2024)**. I used Python, Excel, and Tableau to analyze data, build dashboards, and support business decisions. This improved inventory management and helped the company operate more efficiently.


Later, I interned at **Moncler Group’s APAC Headquarters (2023–2024)** in Shanghai. I helped analyze sales data and manage inventory reports for stores across Greater China. This experience taught me how data supports strategic decisions in global retail businesses.


Currently, I’m also serving as a **Teaching Assistant at Boston University**, where I guide students in understanding analytics concepts and tools like Power BI and Excel.


I'm excited to continue growing my skills in data analytics and business strategy. I aim to use data-driven insights to help organizations make smarter, more effective decisions.
