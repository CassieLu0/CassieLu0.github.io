I‚Äôm currently pursuing my Master‚Äôs in Applied Business Analytics at Boston University (2024‚Äì2026). Here, I‚Äôm learning advanced skills in data analysis, visualization, and business decision-making.\nBefore joining BU, I earned a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in French Language and Literature from Xianda College, Shanghai International Studies University (2020‚Äì2024). My studies gave me strong analytical abilities, language skills, and cross-cultural understanding.\nDuring college, I worked remotely as a Data Analyst for Rishun Industry & Trade Co.¬†(2021‚Äì2024). I used Python, Excel, and Tableau to analyze data, build dashboards, and support business decisions. This improved inventory management and helped the company operate more efficiently.\nLater, I interned at Moncler Group‚Äôs APAC Headquarters (2023‚Äì2024) in Shanghai. I helped analyze sales data and manage inventory reports for stores across Greater China. This experience taught me how data supports strategic decisions in global retail businesses.\nCurrently, I‚Äôm also serving as a Teaching Assistant at Boston University, where I guide students in understanding analytics concepts and tools like Power BI and Excel.\nI‚Äôm excited to continue growing my skills in data analytics and business strategy. I aim to use data-driven insights to help organizations make smarter, more effective decisions.\nPlease feel free to connect with me via LinkedIn:Know me on LinkedIn or email me at (cassielu@bu.edu)"
